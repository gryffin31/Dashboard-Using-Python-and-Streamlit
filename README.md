**Project Setup Instructions**

- Create a new environment using Conda:
  ```
  conda create -p [env_name] python=3.7 -y
  ```

- Activate the newly created environment:
  ```
  conda activate [env_name]
  ```

- Set the Python interpreter for the environment (for IDE integration):
  ```
  [env_name]\python.exe
  ```

- Create a `requirements.txt` file and list the required libraries/packages:
  ```
  [List the libraries here, one per line]
  ```

- Install the required libraries using pip:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Now, you have a dedicated environment for your project with the specified Python version and the necessary libraries installed. You can start developing your project with all the dependencies properly managed. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
